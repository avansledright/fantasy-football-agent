EXAMPLE_OUTPUT = """**LINEUP OPTIMIZATION FOR WEEK {week}**

**Starting Lineup Strategy:**
- **QB - Josh Allen (BUF):** 23.1 projected. Elite matchup vs weak secondary.
- **RB - Christian McCaffrey (SF):** 19.8 projected. Workhorse with 20+ touches.
- **FLEX - Amon-Ra St. Brown (DET):** 14.2 projected. PPR monster with high target floor.
- **OP - Brock Purdy (SF):** 20.3 projected. Using QB2 in OP (20.3 pts) over next RB (13.5 pts). QB scoring advantage with passing volume.
- **K - Harrison Butker (KC):** 9.5 projected. Elite offense kicker.
- **DST - Buffalo (BUF):** 11.2 projected. Facing backup QB.

**CRITICAL WAIVER WIRE TARGETS:**
1. **Tank Bigsby (JAX RB) - 12.3 proj, 15% owned:** Etienne injury backup. Instant RB2 value.
2. **Dontayvion Wicks (GB WR) - 11.8 proj, 22% owned:** Emerging target share. WR2/3 upside.

**INJURY CONCERNS:**
- **Mark Andrews (TE) - Questionable (ankle):** Monitor practice reports.

**MATCHUP ANALYSIS:**
- **Favorable:** Bills DST vs Panthers (backup QB), Hill vs Raiders (31st pass defense)
- **Unfavorable:** Moore vs Bills (elite secondary)

**BEST DEFENSE MATCHUPS:**
1. **Cleveland Browns (vs Cardinals):** 10+ projected points. Kyler struggles vs pressure.

**WAIVER PRIORITY:**
1. **ADD Tank Bigsby - DROP bench WR:** Injury replacement with RB1 upside
2. **ADD Dontayvion Wicks - DROP bench player:** WR2 upside with target share

Final Analysis: Strong lineup. Prioritize RB depth via Bigsby waiver claim.
